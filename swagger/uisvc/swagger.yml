  title: uisvc
  description: >
    API for the user interface service; the service that is directly
    responsible for presenting data to users.

    This service typically runs at the border, and leverages session cookies or
    authentication tokens that we generate for users. It also is responsible
    for handling the act of oauth and user creation through its login hooks.

    uisvc typically talks to the datasvc and other services to accomplish its
    goal, it does not save anything locally or carry state.

        Cancel the run by ID; this will actually trickle back and cancel the
        whole task, since it can no longer succeed in any way.

        Please keep in mind to stop runs, runners must implement a cancel poller.
